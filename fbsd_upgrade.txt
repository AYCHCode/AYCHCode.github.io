    1. Ensure that hw.ata.wc is set to 1.  This was disabled by
    default in FreeBSD 4.3.  It was reenabled shortly after the
    release, because of substantial performance loss.

    Add a line to /etc/loader.conf (hw.ata.wc=1) and reboot.

    2. Track -STABLE: cd /usr/src && cvsup stable-supfile
    
    2.1. Read /usr/src/UPDATING.

    3. Run mergemaster; this should be done by experienced
    personel only. 

    4. If mergemaster did not update /dev, run cd /dev && sh MAKDEV all
    
    5. Extend PATH in /etc/rc to include 
    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/var/qmail/bin

    6. Make sure that /etc/make.conf does not build unnecessary stuff
    (such as Fortran, Objective C, sendmail, profiling libraries)

    7. Check that fsck_y_enable="YES" exists in /etc/rc.conf.
    We do not want fsck to dump into a shell and wait for console
    input.

    8. Check that the config file which you will be using for 
    rebuilding the kernel is up to date and that no new requirements
    were introduced which you have not yet met.

    pair1: SMP/APIC_IO can be set; firewall optional.
    pair2: SMP/APIC_IO MUST NOT be set; firewall MUST be set.

    Ensure that SMP and APIC_IO are only set, if the machine has
    multiple processors.  A SMP kernel will not boot on an UP
    machine. "sysctl hw.ncpu" will tell you the number of CPUs.
	
    9. make buildworld

    10. make buildkernel KERNCONF=NEWPB1

    or NEWPB2 on pair2.
    
    11. make installkernel KERNCONF=NEWPB1

    ditto
    
    12. Reboot.

    13. make installworld

    14. Reboot.
